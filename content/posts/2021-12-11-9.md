> It's a world of laughter, a world of tears  
> It's a world of hopes and a world of fears  
> There's so much that we share  
> That it's time we're aware  
> It's a small world after all  

> It's a small world after all  
> It's a small world after all  
> It's a small world after all  
> It's a small, small world  

> There is just one moon and one golden sun  
> And a smile means friendship to everyone  
> Though the mountains divide  
> And the oceans are wide  
> It's a small world after all  

> It's a small world after all  
> It's a small world after all  
> It's a small world after all  
> It's a small, small world
