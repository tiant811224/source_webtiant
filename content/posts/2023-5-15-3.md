Twenty-five years and my life is still  
廿五年过去 我的一生依旧波澜不惊  
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope  
竭力挣扎 想探到天空星光时候  
For a destination  
为自己一生留念  
I realized quickly when I knew I should  
我这才发现自己后知后觉  
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man  
这是由人类手足情组成的世界  
For whatever that means  
可我仍孤身一人  
And so I cry sometimes  
所以有时我会蜷缩在床  
When I'm lying in bed  
任泪水流下  
Just to get it all out  
渴望泪水洗走  
What's in my head  
心中多少苦悲  
And I am,I am feeling a little peculiar  
这以后 空洞的胸口 却有着莫名悸动  
And so I wake in the morning  
在黎明中醒来  
And I step outside  
我迈出屋外  
And I take a deep breath and I get real high  
我深吸口气 大口呼出愉快  
And I scream from the top of my lungs  
我灵魂共鸣着肺腑大声呐喊  
What's going on?  
这世界怎么了？！  
And I say, hey hey hey hey  
我大喊 嘿  
I said hey, what's going on?  
想知道 未来去向何方  
And I say, hey hey hey hey  
我唱着 嘿  
I said hey, what's going on?  
方才发觉 这就是人生吗？  
ooh, ooh ooh  
  
and I try, oh my god do I try  
我努力着 天啊 我竭力挣扎  
I try all the time, in this institution  
甚至改变去自己 想挣脱命运的桎梏  
And I pray, oh my god do I pray  
我祈祷 威严的神啊 我匍匐在地  
I pray every single day  
日日夜夜的乞求  
For a revolution  
祷告人生的变革  
And so I cry sometimes  
所以有时我会蜷缩在床  
When I'm lying in bed  
任泪水流下  
Just to get it all out  
渴望泪水洗走  
What's in my head  
脑海里太多烦恼  
And I am,I am feeling a little peculiar  
这以后 空白的意识 却听到惊异的共鸣  
And so I wake in the morning  
在黎明中醒来  
And I step outside  
我迈出屋外  
And I take a deep breath and I get real high  
我深吸口气 我深吸口气  
And I scream from the top of my lungs  
我灵魂共鸣着肺腑大声呐喊  
What's going on?  
这世界怎么了？！  
And I say, hey hey hey hey  
我大喊 嘿  
I said hey, what's going on?  
想知道 未来去向何方  
And I say, hey hey hey hey  
我大喊 嘿  
I said hey, what's going on?  
想知道 未来去向何方  
And I say, hey hey hey hey  
我唱着 嘿  
I said hey, what's going on?  
方才发觉 这就是人生吗？  
ooh, ooh ooh  
  
Twenty-five years and my life is still  
廿五年过去 我的一生依旧波澜不惊  
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope  
竭力挣扎 想探到山顶希望的光芒  
For a destination  
只为我这一生
