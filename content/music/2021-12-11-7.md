> And I Love You So  
> The people ask me how  
> How I've lived 'til now  
> I tell them "I don't know"  

> I guess they understand  
> How lonely life has been  
> But life began again  
> The day you took my hand  

> And yes, I know how lonely life can be  
> The shadows follow me  
> And the night won't set me free  
> But I don't let the evening get me down  
> Now that you're around me  
 
> And you love me too  
> Your thoughts are just for me  
> You set my spirit free  
> I'm happy that you do  

> The book of life is brief  
> And once a page is read  
> All but love is dead  
> That is my belief  


> And yes, I know how loveless life can be  
> The shadows follow me  
> And the night won't set me free  
> But I don't let the evening bring me down  
> Now that you're around me  

> And I love you so  
> The people ask me how  
> How I've lived 'til now  
> I tell them "I don't know"
